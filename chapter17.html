      <h2>Chapter 17: HTML5 Layout</h2>
      <p>This chapter covers other ways to organize a layout for your page, but by
        using other tags in your HTML file other than div.

      <h3>New Elements</h3>
      <h4>Header and Footer</h4>
      <p>Header and Footer elements can be used for the top and bottom of every page,
        or for an individual <strong>section</strong> or <strong>article</strong>
        (more on these in a bit.) For example, on a page with several blog posts, each
        individual post can be thought of as a separate section. Theheader element can
        therefore be used to contain the title and date of each individual post, and
        the footer might contain links to share the article on social networking sites.
      </p>
      <h4>Article</h4>
      <p>Article is useful for any part of the page that could stand alone. Like an
        individual article, blog entry, forum post, or comment.
      </p>
      <h4>Aside</h4>
      <p>Asides have a couple of uses. When used in conjunction with an article, an
        aside could be used as a pullquote or a glossary. It should contain information
        related to the article. When used outside of an article, it should contain
        information related to the entire page. Links to other sections of the site,
        list of recent posts, search box, recent tweets, etc.
      </p>
      <h4>Section</h4>
      <p>Sections group related content together. Typically each section would
        have its own heading. An example would be latest news, top products, newsletter
        signup would all be an individual section. Each section could have multiple
        articles inside. The section element should NOT be used for the entire page.
        If you want one containing element for the entire page, you're better off
        using the div element.
      </p>
      <h4>Figure and Figcaption</h4>
      <p>back in Chapter 5, we talked about the Figure element. It's used to contain
        any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article (not just images).
        You should generally use figure for videos, images, graphs, diagrams, code samples,
        and text that supports the main body of the article. Figcaption is placed inside
        the figure element, and used to give a text description of what is inside the figure.
      </p>
      <h4>Back to div</h4>
      <p>After going through the uses for all the above elements (and doing a little further
        reading,) if you don't think you should be using any of them then you're better
        off just using a div tag.
      </p>
      <h4>Block link</h4>
      <p>You can turn an entire block level element into a link by containing it into
        an a element. Simply add <strong>&#60a href="link.html"&#62</strong> to the top,
        and <strong>&#60/a&#62</strong> to the bottom.
      </p>
