      <h2>Chapter 10: Introducing CSS</h2>
        <p>While I have already gone through the track on Codeacademy, I feel
           like I would still be better off going through this chapter and
           rewriting anything thats not painfully obvious.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="style">
      <h4>Style Rules</h4>
      <p>CSS code looks like the following: <br />
         p {<br />
           color:white; <br />
         }<br />
         In this code, <strong>p</strong> is the selector. <strong>color: white;
         </strong> is the declaration. In the declaration, <strong>color</strong>
         is a property, while <strong>white</strong> is a value.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="html">
      <h4>HTML and CSS</h4>
      <p>There are two ways of adding CSS to an HTML file, you can either link
         your CSS while with the HTML file, or inject CSS rules directly into the
         HTML code. If you have multiple pages, it's usually best to create a
         separate file so that you can reuse your code. This way also makes it
         easier to make chasnges to code, since you only have to edit one file.<br />
         To link the files together, you need to add the fopllowing code inside your
         head element:<br />
         &#60link href="pathtoCSSfile.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" /&#62<br />
         The type specifies the type of document being linked, and the rel specifies
         the relationship between the two files.<br />
         To add CSS code directly into the HTML file, all you have to do is in the header
         create &#60style type="text/css"&#62 and &#60/style&#62 elements, with
         CSS code in the middle.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="selectors">
      <h4>Selectors</h4>
      <p>Selectors usually follow a rule that the most specific takes precedent.
         If you have a rule for all p elements, then a rule for only p elements
         within a class, the p elements within the class will take priority. Below
         are most of the selectors and how to use them. You can also specify for one
         rule to always take precedent, by adding !important to the end, but still before
         the semicolon. <br />
         Universal Selector: Applies to all elements: * {}<br/>
         Type Selector: Matches element names: h1, h1, h3 {} - targets all h1, h2, and h3 elements.<br />
         Class Selector: Targets elements with matching class: .class {} - p.class {} -
         Targets all classes named "class." Second targets all p elements with class id "class".<br />
         ID Selector: Same rules as class, except targets ID: #introduction {}<br />
         Child Selector: Element thats direct child of another: li &#62 a {} - targets only
         &#60a&#62 elements that are children of &#60li&#62. <br />
         Descendant Selector: All elements that are descended (child, grandchild, etc): p a {} -
         Would select all a elements that are nested inside a p element, even if other nested elements between.<br />
         Adjacent Sibling Selector: Matches element that is next sibling of another: h1+p {} -
         Targets only first p element after a h1 element, but not the other p elements. <br />
         General Sibling Selector: Matches all siblings, does not have to be directly preceding: h1~p {} -
         If theres 2 p elements that are siblings of h1, rule would apply to both.</p>

      <h2>Chapter 11: Colors</h2>
        <p>This chapter focuses on changing colors. This section will be very brief
           because most of the information is very self explanatory.</p><br />
    </div>
    <div class="colors">
      <h4>Foreground and Background Colors</h4>
      <p>Before we get started, here are some very useful links.<br />
        <a href="http://www.paletton.com">Palleton</a> is useful for choosing
        an entire color scheme.<br />
        <a href="www.snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html">This</a> tool
        is useful for checking how well colors contrast with each other.<br />
        Using the "color" and "background-color" properties, you can specify color in 4 different ways: Color
        name, RGB, hex value, or HSL.<br />
        Color name: color: DarkCyan;<br />
        RGB: background-color: rgb(100, 100, 90);<br />
        Hex value: color: #9a87bd;<br />
        HSL (hue, saturation light): background-color: hsl(305, 50%, 100%);<br />
        HSL numbers are used as follows: 0-360 (color wheel number is the angle),
        then a percent from 0-100 for staursation, then a percent from 0-100 for
        lightness.<br />
        <br />
        At the time of this writing, RGB and HSL seem to be the best options because
        they support alpha channels by use of RGBA and HSLA. To use alpha, you just
        add a 4th number inside the parenthesis ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. 0.0 being 0%
        (fully see through) and 1.0 being 100% (completely visible.)<br />
        color: rgba(248, 148, 264, 0.4);<br />
        background-color: hsla(302, 50%, 25%, 0.75);<br />
      </p>
