      <h2>Chapter 19: Practical Information</h2>
      <p>This chapter covers SEO Optimization, analytics, and publishing your site.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Search Engine optimization (SEO)</h3>
      <p>SEO is the practice of getting your website to show up closer to the top when
        people search for related topics. Search engines not only look at what appears
        on your site, but also how many sites link to you (and how relevant they are.)
        SEO is often split into two areas: on page techniques and off page techniques.
      </p>
      <h4>Off Page Techniques</h4>
      <p>Off page techniques are pretty small in how much you can do to help. Really
        you need other pages to link to you. Search engines really look at the words
        between the &#60a&#62 tags. It may be considered more relevant if it contains
        more keywords.
      </p>
      <h4>On Page Techniques</h4>
      <p>On page techniques are the most effective, starting with keywords. You want
        to have kjeywords that people will enter into a search engine, and include these
        words in your HTML and text for your site. There are 7 places you want your site
        to have keywords:
        <dl>
          <dt>1. Page Title</dt>
            <dd>The page title. Sits inside the title element, inside the head element.</dd>
          <dt>2. URL/Web Address</dt>
            <dd>Name of file is part of web address. Where possible, use keywords in file name.</dd>
          <dt>3. Headings</dt>
            <dd>If a keyword is in a heading (h1, h2, h3, etc) then the search engine
              will know the page is about that subnject. Gives this text greater weight.</dd>
          <dt>4. Text</dt>
            <dd>Helps to repeat the keyword 2-3 times in the main body of the text (where
              possible.) You don't want to overuse the word.</dd>
          <dt>5. Link Text</dt>
            <dd>Use keywords in the text that creates links between pages (instead of
              phrases like "click here.")</dd>
          <dt>6. Image Alt Text</dt>
            <dd>Accurate alt text for images will help them show up in image searches.</dd>
          <dt>7. Page Descriptions</dt>
            <dd>Also lives inside the head element, specified using a <strong>meta</strong>
              tag. It should be a sentence that describes the content of the page. These
              sentences won't be shown on the page, but might show up in results page
              on a search engine.</dd>
        </dl>
        There are 6 steps to identifying keywords:<br />
        <br />
        1. Brainstorm: Think of keywords that describe your content.<br />
        2. Organize: Group keywords in separate lists for separate sections of your site.<br />
        3. Research: Use websites like <a href="adwords.google.co.uk/select/KeywordToolExternal">google</a>
        to find similar keywords. You can also use <a href="www.wordtracker.com">Wordtracker</a>
        and <a href="www.keyworddiscovery.com">Keyworddiscovery.</a><br />
        4. Compare: Use tools like googles advanced search to see how much competition
        you have for your keywords.<br />
        5. Refine: Pick the most relevant keywords to focus on. You should stiff use
        phrases, even if there is a lot of competition.<br />
        6. Map: Pick 3-5 keywords or phrases that map to each page of your website,
        and use them as keywords for each page. You don't need to repeat the same keywords
        on all the pages. As you get further away from the home page, your keywords will
        likely become more specific.</p>

      <h3>Analytics</h3>
      <p>The first thing you should do is sign up for the <a href="www.google.com/analytics">Google
        Analytics Service.</a> It will give you a piece of code to add on every page
        of your site. Analytics gives you a wealth of info, as well as tools like:<br />
        <ul>
          <li>the number of visits</li>
          <li>the number of unique visits</li>
          <li>total number of page views</li>
          <li>avg number of pages a visitor looks at</li>
          <li>avg time on site</li>
          <li>a date selector to check within a range</li>
          <li>export this information for excel</li>
          <li>what users are looking at</li>
          <li>where they came from.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h4>Domain Names and Hosting</h4>
      <p>Usually, you have to pay an annual fee to keep a domain name once you find one.
        As for web hosting, there are a few things you should look out for. The amount of
        disk space offered, the bandwith, backups, if they offer email accounts, server-side
        languages and databases.<br />
        Many services will require you to use ftp to upload files to the server, as well
        as a username and password. You will probably need a ftp application, some
        common ones are:<br />

        <a href="cuteftp.com">CuteFTP</a>, and <a href="SmartFTP">SmartFTP</a>.<br />

        <a href="posterous.com">Posterous</a>.<br />
