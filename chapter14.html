      <h2>Chapter 14: Lists, Tables, and Forms</h2>
        <p>This chapter focuses on styling more aspects of HTML.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list">
      <h4>Lists</h4>
      <p><strong>list-style-type:</strong> can be used to give the bullets/numbers
        a different look. For unordered list you can give a value of none, disc, square,
        or circle. For ordered list, you can give a value of decimal, decimal-leading-zero,
        lower-alpha, upper-alpha, lower-roman, or upper-roman. You would put these
        declarations inside an ul or ol selector.<br />
        If you want to use a custom image for an unordered list, you can use
        <strong>list-image-style:</strong> Similar to how we used this for borders,
        you just need a value of <strong>url("image.png");</strong><br />
        <strong>list-style-position:</strong> lets you decide if you want your bullet
        points or numbers sit inside or outside the list. The values you can give
        are inside or outside.<br />
        You can use a shorthand version to put these all together. <strong>list-style:</strong>
        You can write the values in any order, such as "inside circle;"</p>
    </div>
    <div class="table">
      <h4>Tables</h4>
      <p>When creating tables, there are a few guidelines you should follow. Give the
        cells some padding, make the headings distinguished, shade alternate rows,
        align numerals. Get comfortable making borders on only one or two sides.
        <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/53tmuj05/">Here</a> is an example of a table
        created using many css rules we have seen so far.<br >
        <strong>empty-cells:</strong> property accepts 3 values: show, hide, inherit.
        Show hide affect how empty cells will show a border, and inherit will make any
        table inherited inside another table do what the parent table is defined to do.<br />
        <strong>border-spacing:</strong> is used to separate cells from each other. You
        give 2 values, a horizontal pixel width and a vertical. Usually specified in pixels.<br />
        <strong>border-collapse:</strong> is used to combine 2 cell borders into one. You can
        give it two values: collapse and separate.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="form">
      <h4>Forms</h4>
      <p>It's important to remember that forms seem simple, but have a lot of flexibility
        as to how you can style them. In the book on page 342, there's an example
        that shows some common ways that text-inputs are styled. It uses the following:
        font-size, color, background-color, border, border-radius, :focus, :hover, and
        background-image.<br />
        Submit buttons are also flexible, the example in the book uses color, text-shadow,
        border-bottom, background-color, and different rules for :hover. The book also
        uses a background-gradient property that is unmentioned, so I will need to
        research this one on my own.<br />
        Using the rules above, you can also stylize a fieldset and legend (used to group forms
        together, Chapter 7.) There is too much information here to dumb down into
        smaller notes, so refer to page 345 for the proper way to style text inputs and forms
        into alignment.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cursor">
      <h4>Cursor</h4>
      <p>Although I will probably never use this, you can change the cursor with
        <strong>cursor:</strong> Accepted values are: auto, crosshair, default, pointer,
        move, text, wait, help, and url("cursor.gif")</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sample">
      <h2>Sample Page</h2>
      <p><a href="chapter14ex.html">Here</a> is an example page from the book. The
        CSS is written directly into the HTML code. Here you will see plenty of examples
        from this chapter, as well as previous chapters.</p>
