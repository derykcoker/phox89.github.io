      <h2>Chapter 15: Layout</h2>
      <p>This is possibly the most important chapter. Most of the information
        here is used to teach you how to create a layout for your webpage. Styling
        blocks into the correct space/slot that you want.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
      <p>Before digging in, let's review block and inline elements. Block elements
        start on a new line and act as the main building blocks. Inline boxes flow
        between surrounding text. Remember you can use borders, padding, and margins
        to separate boxes.<br />
        When one block element sits inside another block element, the containing
        element is known as the containing element, or parent element. For example,
        a p element inside a div element. The div is the parent (or containing) and
        p is the child.<br />
        There are 3 positioning schemes: normal flow, relative positioning, and
        absolute positioning. You also should know the difference between Fixed Positioning
        and Floating Elements. Fixed Positioning is a form of absolute positioning in which
        the position of the element is based on the browser window, as opposed to the
        containing element. They do not effect the positioning of surrounding elements.
        Floating Elements allow you to take an element out of normal flow, and position
        it to the far right or left of a containing box. The floating element becomes a block
        level element that allows other content to flow around.<br />
        Also remember, when moving a box from normal flow, boxes can sometimes overlap.
        Use the z-index property to control which box appears on top.</p>
      <h4>Normal Flow</h4>
      <p>In normal flow, each blcok level sits on top of another. This is the default
        way that browsers treat HTML. It's unnecessary to specify this in CSS, but if
        you are ever inclined to do so, the syntax is:<br />
        <strong>position: static;</strong></p>
      <h4>Relative Positioning</h4>
        <p><strong>position: relative;</strong> will allow you to move an element
          where it would have been in relation to normal flow. You can move a box
          horizontally with left or right properties, and up and down with top and
          bottom properties. The values can be given in pixels, ems, or percent.</p>
      <h4>Absolute Positioning</h4>
        <p><strong>position: absolute;</strong> will take the box out of normal flow.
          This box will no longer have an affect on positioning of other elements. The
          other boxes will act as if this box is not even there.</p>
      <h4>Fixed Positioning</h4>
        <p><strong>position: fixed;</strong> is a type of absolute positioning. This will
          set an element into a fixed position on the browser. An example would be a
          header that stays at the top of the window when you're scrolling through the page.
          You still need to use the box offset properties (top, bottom, right, left) to
          place the box in the proper location.</p>
      <h4>Overlapping Elements</h4>
        <p><strong>z-index:</strong> is used to give boxes a way to decide which one is on top. A
          larger number will bring the box closer to the front, while a smaller number will
          push a box further to the back. Relative, absolute, and fixed positioning can all
          have issues with boxes overlapping. So if you run into this issue, using z-index
          will keep your boxes organized.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Flow</h3>
        <p>The <strong>float</strong> property allows you to take an element in normal
          flow and push it as far to the right or the left as possible. Anything else
          inside the containing element will flow around the floated element. So, the
          values you can use are left and right. You should also always define a width
          for the floated element, so that it will not span the width of the page.</p>
      <h4>Columns</h4>
        <p>You can use float to make boxes sit side by side as if they're columns. with
          the following code, you'll be able to create columns that side side by side.<br />
          <br />
          body {<br />
            width: 750px;<br />
            font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;<br />
            color: #665544;}<br />
            p {<br />
            width: 230px;<br />
            float: left;<br />
            margin: 5px;<br />
            padding: 5px;<br />
            background-color: #efefef;}<br />
          <br />
          Although this code does work, there is one issue. The 4th column will
          sit underneath the 3rd column. You can fix this by using the <strong>clear
          </strong> property. You can give it values of left, right, both, or none. This
          property allows you to tell a box that it can't touch other boxes on the
          defined side. For example, since the 4th paragraph sits under the 3rd instead
          of starting a new column, you can give it a  class "clear" and give that class
          a declaration of <strong>clear: left;</strong> Now the element will nnot be
          allowed to touch any other element within the containing element on the left
          side.<br />
          If a containing element only contains floated elements, some browsers will
          treat it as if it is zero pixels tall. You can fix this by assigning the containing
          element a few declarations. Add in <strong>overflow: auto;</strong> as well
          as <strong>width: 100%</strong> to fix this. In the book on page 373, you can
          see a div element that looks like 2 lines because of this issue.<br />
          <br />
          In order to create multiple columns, many pages will achieve this by create multiple
          div elements. Give each a class name like "column1of2" or whatever you feel
          is appropriate, then assign each a width property, float property, and margins.
        </p>

      <h3>Layout</h3>
      <p>There are 2 types of layouts, Fixed Width and Liquid.</p>
      <h4>Fixed Width Layout</h4>
      <p>Fixed width layouts do not change size based on the size of the screen.
        Measurements are usually fiven in pixels.<br />
        <strong>Advantages:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Pixel values are accurate at controlling element sizes and positioning.</li>
          <li>Far greater control with appearance and position of items on the page.</li>
          <li>You can control length of lines of text regardless of size of user's window.</li>
          <li>Size of an image will always remain the same relative to rest of page.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Disadvantages</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Can end up with big gaps at edge of page.</li>
            <li>If the user's screen is higher res than designer's screen, page can look
              smaller and text can be more difficult to read.</li>
            <li>If user increases text size, text might not fit into allotted spaces.</li>
            <li>Design works best on devices that have similar resolutions to desktops
              or laptops.</li>
            <li>Page will often take up more vertical space than a liquid layout.</li>
          </ul>
        To create a fixed width layout, the width of boxes will usually be specified in
        pixels. Sometimes the height will be as well. <a href="chapter15ex1.html">Here</a> is
        an example page from the book. Make sure you change the size of the browser window to
        see how it changes.<br />
        The body element is fixed to 960 pixels, centered by setting left right margins to auto.
        Main boxes on the page have a margin of 10 to create a gap. Nav, feature, and footer
        panels stretch to width of containing element (ion this casethe body element) so
        there is no need to define a width for them. 3 Columns are all 300 pixels
        wide and use the float property to sit next to each other.
      </p>
      <h4>Liquid Layout</h4>
      <p>Liquid layouts will change based on the size of the browser window.<br />
        <strong>Advantages:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Pages expand to fill entire browser window, no spaces around the page on larger screens.</li>
          <li>If user has a small window, the page can contract to fit everything.</li>
          <li>Design is tolerant of the user setting custom font sizes.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Disadvantages:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>If you don't control width of sections, design can look different than intended.
              Unexpected gaps, items squashed together, etc.</li>
            <li>If user has a wide window, lines of text can become longer and harder to read.</li>
            <li>If user has a narrow window, words can be squashed together and may only have
              a few words on each line.</li>
            <li>If a fixed width item, like an image, is in a box too small to hold it, then
              the image can overflow onto text.</li>
          </ul>
        It's usually best to only let parts of the pages expand or contract. A liquid layout
        is uaually specified in percentages rather than pixels.<a href="chapter15ex2.html">Here</a>
        is an example of a liquid layout. As before, make sure you change browser window
        size so you can see the effects.<br />
        The body element is set to 90% so there's a small gap between the edge of the page.
        The 3 columns are all given a margin of 1% and a width of 31.3%. Adds up to 99.9%
        of the body element, so some browsers may not align the right hand column properly.
        Div element for nav, features, and footer will stretch to width of the body, they
        were given a 1% margin to help them algign with the columns.<br />
        Although they weren't used in this example, you can see how the min-width and
        max-width properties can be useful to limit how much elements can stretch or contract.
      </p>
      <h4>Layout Grids</h4>
      <p>Many web designers use a grid called the <a href="https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/960-12-col-grid.jpg">
        960 grid.</a> As you can see, this grid makes it much simpler to design
        a page. Each column is 60 pixels wide, with a 10 pixel margin. This grid helps
        to create continuity between different pages, helps users predict where to find
        information on new pages, makes it easier to add new content in a consistent way,
        and helps people collaborate consistently.
