      <h2>Chapter 15: Layout</h2>
      <p>This is possibly the most important chapter. Most of the information
        here is used to teach you how to create a layout for your webpage. Styling
        blocks into the correct space/slot that you want.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Key Concepts</h4>
      <p>Before digging in, let's review block and inline elements. Block elements
        start on a new line and act as the main building blocks. Inline boxes flow
        between surrounding text. Remember you can use borders, padding, and margins
        to separate boxes.<br />
        When one block element sits inside another block element, the containing
        element is known as the containing element, or parent element. For example,
        a p element inside a div element. The div is the parent (or containing) and
        p is the child.<br />
        There are 3 positioning schemes: normal flow, relative positioning, and
        absolute positioning. You also should know the difference between Fixed Positioning
        and Floating Elements. Fixed Positioning is a form of absolute positioning in which
        the position of the element is based on the browser window, as opposed to the
        containing element. They do not effect the positioning of surrounding elements.
        Floating Elements allow you to take an element out of normal flow, and position
        it to the far right or left of a containing box. The floating element becomes a block
        level element that allows other content to flow around.<br />
        Also remember, when moving a box from normal flow, boxes can sometimes overlap.
        Use the z-index property to control which box appears on top.</p>
      <h5>Normal Flow</h5>
      <p>In normal flow, each blcok level sits on top of another. This is the default
        way that browsers treat HTML. It's unnecessary to specify this in CSS, but if
        you are ever inclined to do so, the syntax is:<br />
        <strong>position: static;</strong></p>
      <h5>Relative Positioning</h5>
        <p><strong>position: relative;</strong> will allow you to move an element
          where it would have been in relation to normal flow. You can move a box
          horizontally with left or right properties, and up and down with top and
          bottom properties. The values can be given in pixels, ems, or percent.</p>
      <h5>Absolute Positioning</h5>
        <p><strong>position: absolute;</strong> will take the box out of normal flow.
          This box will no longer have an affect on positioning of other elements. The
          other boxes will act as if this box is not even there.</p>
      <h5>Fixed Positioning</h5>
        <p><strong>position: fixed;</strong> is a type of absolute positioning. This will
          set an element into a fixed position on the browser. An example would be a
          header that stays at the top of the window when you're scrolling through the page.
          You still need to use the box offset properties (top, bottom, right, left) to
          place the box in the proper location.</p>
      <h5>Overlapping Elements</h5>
        <p><strong>z-index:</strong> is used to give boxes a way to decide which one is on top. A
          larger number will bring the box closer to the front, while a smaller number will
          push a box further to the back. Relative, absolute, and fixed positioning can all
          have issues with boxes overlapping. So if you run into this issue, using z-index
          will keep your boxes organized.</p>
