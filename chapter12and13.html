      <h2>Chapter 12: Text</h2>
        <p>This chapter covers the different formats and stylings you can use for
          text.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="typeface">
      <h4>Typeface</h4>
      <p><strong>Serif:</strong> fonts that have extra details at the ends, easier
        to read for long passages. Times Roman and Georgia are the most common.<br />
        <Strong>Sans-Serif:</strong> fonts that do NOT have extra details at the ends.
        Can be clearer to read. Helvetica and Arial are the most common.<br />
        <strong>Monospace:</strong> fonts where all the letters have the same width.
        Useful for coding since the letters will always align together. Courier is
        a common font in this category.<br />
        <strong>font-weight:</strong> Light, Medium, Bold, Black. Used for emphasis, can
        also help to show contrast.<br />
        <strong>font-style:</strong> Normal, Italic, Oblique. Italic gives the font a
        more cursive style, while oblique just angles the font.<br />
        <strong>font-stretch:</strong> Condensed, Regular, Extended. Condenses will make
        the letters thinner and closer together, while extended makes the letters
        wider and further apart.<br />
        <br />
        When choosing a font type, a font will only display when the font is already
        installed on the viewers computer, or unless you add some code (explained later.)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="font">
      <h4>Font Family</h4>
      <p>Using <strong>font-family</strong> allows you to specify which font to use
        on your page. Common practice is to list 3 items separated by commas. The first
        should be the font you want to use, 2<sup>nd</sup> a backup font, and 3<sup>rd</sup>
        the typeface incase the first 2 are unavailable. This way the viewers browser
        can choose a font for them.<br />
        <br />
        font-family: Georgia, Times, serif;<br />
        font-family: "Courier New", Courier, monospace;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="size">
      <h4>Text Size</h4>
      <p>There are 3 different methods to choosing a font size: pixels, percent, and em.<br />
        font-size: 12px; Pixel is pretty self explanatory. Just choose the px size you want.
        This is the most common method.<br />
        font-size: 75%; Default pixel size is 16 px, so this code would change the font size to 12.
        However, percentages do chain together. If you were to make all text inside the body
        element 75% (12 px) and then created an addition rule for p tags to be 75%, then
        all p elements inside the body element would be 9%.<br />
        font-size: 1.5em; Em is useful for text size relative to parent (not used as much).
        Below are some Examples of how each would look in code.<br />
        body = 16px = 100% = 1em<br />
        h3 = 18px = 133% = 1.125em<br />
        h2 = 24px = 150% = 1.5em<br />
        h1 = 32px = 200% = 2em</p>
    </div>
    <div class="face">
      <h4>Font Face</h4>
      <p>@font-face can be used to add a font to your page that a user does not
        have installed. This code will tell the user's browser to download the font
        from the given source. An easy way to do this is to go to
        <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">This</a> webpage from Google. Once you
        pick the font you want, you will see a code for you to embed into the
        head element in your HTML document. Once you do that, you can use the
        <strong>font-family</strong> property in your CSS document to choose the font
        without the need to use @font-family.<br />
        However, if you would rather upload your own font, you will need to upload
        the font in 4 different formats: eot, woff, ttf/otf, svg. Below is an example
        of how the code would look for a font titled ChunkFiveRegular.<br />
          @font-face {<br />
          font-family: 'ChunkFiveRegular';<br />
          src: url('fonts/chunkfive.eot');<br />
          src: url('fonts/chunkfive.eot?#iefix')<br />
          format('embedded-opentype'),<br />
          url('fonts/chunkfive.woff') format('woff'),<br />
          url('fonts/chunkfive.ttf')<br />
          format('truetype'),<br />
          url('fonts/chunkfive.svg#ChunkFiveRegular')<br />
          format('svg');}</p>
    </div>
    <div class="transformation">
      <h4>Text Transformations and Effects</h4>
      <p><strong>text-transform:</strong> uppercase, lowercase, capitalize;<br />
        Capitalizes all letters, all letters are lowercase, and capitalizes the
        first letter of each word.<br />
        <strong>text-decoration:</strong> none, underline, overline, line-through, blink;<br />
        These are all obvious, except blink. Blink causes the word to blink, and is
        frowned upon due to this being extremely annoying.<br />
        <strong>line-height:</strong> 1.4em;<br />
        Line-height is interesting. Best used in em due to the fact that some users
        will change the text size in browser. This changes the veritcal gap between lines
        of text. Think of it like spacing from Microsoft Word.<br />
        <strong>letter-spacing:</strong> and <strong>word-spacing:</strong> .4em;<br />
        Kerning is the term used by typographers for the space between each letter.
        The value given will be added on top of the default value specified by the font.
        The default value between words is ~0.25em. You probably won't need to change
        the space between words unless you increase letter spacing, and want to help
        the text be a little more readable/<br />
        <strong>text-align:</strong> left, right, center, justify;<br />
        Aligns text to the left, right, or center. Justify dictates that every line
        should take up the full width of the box, except the final line. Justified
        text looks at the words on each individual line and creates an equal gap between
        those words. Can look odd if you have larger words mixed in. Better to align left
        most of the time.<br />
        <strong>vertical-align:</strong> baseline, sub, super, top, text-top, middle,
        bottom, text-bottom.<br />
        Not intended to vertically align text in the middle of block elements like p
        and div, but does have this effect when used in table cells. Its use is more for
        inline elements like img, em, or strong.<br />
        <strong>text-indent:</strong> 20px;
        Used to indent the first line of text. Can use a negative value to push
        text off of the browser window.<br />
        <strong>text-shadow:</strong> 1px 1px 1px #000000;<br />
        Takes 4 values: First value = length to the left or right shadow should fall.
        Second value = distance to top or bottom shadow should fall. Third value (optional)
        = amount of blue to apply. Fourth value = color. Might not be 100% supported
        in every browser, when using make sure to test.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="pseudo">
      <h4>Pseudo-Elements and Pseudo-Classes</h4>
      <p>A pseudo-element acts like an extra element is in the code. Whereas a
        pseudo-class acts like an extra value for a class attribute. You specify them
        both at the end of the selector in your CSS code. The first 2 examples below
        are pseudo-elements, and the rest are pseudo-classes.<br />
        <strong>first-letter</strong> and <strong>first-line</strong><br />
        used to only apply to the first letter or first line. Code looks like this:<br />
        p.intro:first-letter {<br />
        font-size: 200%; }<br />
        p.intro:first-line {<br />
        font-weight: bold; }<br />
        <br />
        <strong>:link :visited :hover :active</strong><br />
        These are useful for links you have on your page. A common way to use these
        is for changing the color, adding underlines, etc. Some sample code is below.<br />
        a:link {<br />
          color: deeppink;<br />
          text-decoration: none;}<br />
          a:visited {<br />
          color: black;}<br />
          a:hover {<br />
          color: deeppink;<br />
          text-decoration: underline;}<br />
          a:active {<br />
          color: darkcyan;}<br />
        <br />
        <strong>:hover :active :focus</strong><br />
        Hover is used when the mouse cursor is placed over an item, such as a link
        or a button. Active is when an element is being activated by the user (like a button.)
        Focus occurs when a browser discovers that you are ready to interact with an
        element on the page. For example, when your cursor is in a form input ready
        to accept typing.<br />
        Pseudo classes should be used in the following order:<br />
        <ul>
          <li>:link</li>
          <li>:visited</li>
          <li>:hover</li>
          <li>:focus</li>
          <li>:active</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="attribute-selectors">
      <h4>Attribute Selectors</h4>
      <p>Below are a set of attribute selectors that allow you to create rules that
        apply to elements that have an attribute with a specific value.<br />

    <div class="chapter">
      <h2>Chapter 13: Boxes</h2>
      <p>This chapter covers how boxes work. Padding, margins, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="dimensions">
      <h4>Box Dimension</h4>
      <p>Using <strong>height:</strong> and <strong>width:</strong> you can control
        the size of your boxes that contain elements. You can specify by pixels,
        percent, or ems. Percentages size will be used based on the "parent box." So if
        a p element is set to 75% inside a div element set to 400x400 pixels, the box for
        the p element would be 300x300 pixels. When using ems, the size of the box depends
        on the size of the text within. Developers have started to use percentages and ems
        more lately to accomodate more devices.<br />
        You can also use <strong>min-width, max-width, min-height</strong> and
        <strong>max-height</strong> to set minimum/maximum values for boxes. min/max-width
        are both useful for smaller screens.<br />
        If the boxes are set too smal to fit all of the content, you can use the
        <strong>overflow:</strong> property. The values you can use are hidden (to hide
        the overflowing content) or scroll (to add a scrollbar to the box.) You can also
        use visible, but if the box is already overflowing and overflow is not being used,
        then there isn't really a point.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="border">
      <h4>Borders, Margins, and Padding</h4>
        <p>some people can really struggle with this subject. Before explaining,
          a good example of each can be found <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/freelance-1/unit-4/diagram-boxmodel.svg">
          here.</a> Basically, border is the outside of the box. Margins refer to
          the space between neighboring boxes. Padding refers to the space between
          the border and the content inside the box.<br />
          <strong>border-width</strong> can be specified in a few ways. The first way
          is to define one pixel size, such as <strong>border-width: 5px;</strong>
          You can also thin, medium, or thick. The final way is similar to the first.
          If you define 2 pixel sizes, then the first will define the top and bottom,
          and the second the left and right. If you define 4 pixel sizes, then you can
          define each side. The order is clockwise starting from the top (top, right, bottom, left.)<br />
          <strong>border-style</strong> allows you to give the border a different look.
          Just simply type <strong>border-style: solid;</strong> There are a many
          different styles, which can be seen <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-style#Values">here.</a><br />
          <strong>border-color</strong> is self explanatory. It follows the same rules as above
          as far as coloring each side or altogether, but you must use RGB or a hex value.<br />
          You can combine these 3 together into one statement by writing them in the
          same as order as presented above.<br />
          border: 5px dotted #8f7c6a;<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Padding</strong> and <strong>margin</strong> are usually specified
          in pixels, but you can use percentages or ems instead if you would rather.
          It's important to remember that if you specify a box to be 200 pixels wide,
          the content will be automatically scaled based on the padding size, and border
          size. When one box is sitting under another, the larger margin will be used
          insted of adding them together. So if one box with a 15 pixel margin is sitting
          above a box with a 25 pixel margin, the space between the boxes will only be 25 pixels.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="styling">
      <h4>Styling Content</h4>
        <strong>Centering</strong> a box on a page is pretty simple. You just need
        to set the left and right margins to "auto." When doing this, make sure to set
        a width for the box, otherwise it will be the width of the entire page.
        It's a good idea to also add <strong>text-align: center;</strong> to any text
        inside a centered box, for older browsers.<br />
        <strong>display</strong> can be used to change inline elements to block, and vice
        versa. With the display property, you can use the following values: block, inline,
        none, and inline-block. None hides the block from the page, while inline-block
        allows block level elements to flow like inline, but still retain block features.
        Go back to page 317 for more info. You can also use <strong>visibility: hidden;
        </strong> to hide a block. When using this method, the space intended for
        the block wil still show though.<br />
        <strong>border-image</strong> can be used to have a custom image used for the border.
        You will have to specify 3 things: the url for the image, where to slice the image,
        and what to do with straight images. You can choose stretch to stretch the image,
        repeat to repeat it, or round to try to repeat the image, but scaled so it will
        fit perfectly. The code will look like this following:<br />
        <strong>border-image: url("imagesource.jpg") 10 10 10 10 round;</strong><br />
        You can also add "-moz-" and "-webkit-" as a prefix to border-image to help
        with compability with earlier browser versions. It's a good idea to have 3 total
        lines: one with moz, one with webkit, and one normal.<br />
        <strong>box-shadow</strong> functions similar to border-image. It also lends
        syntax from text-shadow. You must use the first 2 of the 4 total values
        (horizontal offset, vertical offset, blur distance, shadow spread.) You can
        also use the <strong>inset</strong> value at the beginning to create a shadow
        inside the box. This code will look like <strong>box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px 5px #FFF777;</strong>
        As with border-image, it's best to create 3 lines using "-moz-" and "-webkit-"<br />
        <strong>Rounded</strong> and <strong>elliptical</strong> borders are fairly simple.
        To round all the corners all you need to do is type <strong>border-radius: 5px;</strong>
        (As with the previous 2 lines of code, use moz and webkit.) To create a full circle,
        you just have to set the border radius to the same height as the box. You can create elipses
        by specifying each corner individually with <strong>border-top-left-radius:</strong>
        or something similar for each corner. When doing this, you can use one value for an evenly
        rounded corner, or 2 values. When you using 2 values. like 25px and 50px, the corner will
        round at 50 px wide, but 25 px tall.<br />
        You can do this in a shorthand version by specifying 4 horizontal values and
        4 vertical values all in one line. This will require further testing on jsfiddle to
        get a feel for how it works, but the code will look like this:
        <strong>border-radius: 1em 4em 1 em 4em / 2em 1em 2em 1em;</strong></p>
