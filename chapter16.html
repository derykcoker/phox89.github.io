    <div>
      <h2>Chapter 16: Images</h2>
      <p>This chapter focuses on how to size and align images affectively
        in your HTML page.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Size and Alignment</h3>
      <p>To control the size of an image, you use the height and width properties
        like you would with other boxes. A good idea is to create classes for
        image sizes you would like to use (like small, medium, large) then define
        them in CSS with img.small, img.medium, img.large. When added images through
        html, just define the image with whichever class you would like to use.<br />
        Aligning images is done in a similar way. In HTML code the image will be given
        two classes: align-left or align-right, and then the size. In CSS you create
        a rule for img.align-left that includes float:left. You then create another for
        align-right. So in HTML the code would be:<br />
        &#60img src="imgsrc.jpg" class="align-left medium' alt="whatever"&#62<br />
        Then in CSS you would add<br />
        img.align-left {<br />
          float: left;<br />
          margin: 10px;}<br />
        Adding a margin in is a great idea to keep everything separated.<br />
        By default, images are inline elements. If you would like to center one,
        you would have to convert it to a block level element by using <strong>
        display: block;</strong> in your CSS file (best to give the image a class
        such as align-center.) After that has been done, there are 2 ways to center
        the image:<br />
        Use text-align: center; on the containing element, or<br />
        On the image itself, set the left and right margins to auto.<br />
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Background Images</h3>
      <p>You can use <strong>background-image: url("image.jpg");</strong> to set
        the background image for a box. If you set it to be the body element, it
        will be the background for the entire page. Background images are usually the
        last thing to load, so larger images are usually not recommended.<br />
        <strong>background-repeat:</strong> and <strong>background-attachment:</strong>
        are pretty self explanatory. Repeat can have 4 values: repeat (repeats
        on x and y axes,) repeat-x(repeats on x axis,) repeat-y(repeats on y axis,)
        and no-repeat. Attachment can have 2 values: fixed (background image stays in
        one spot) or scroll (image moves up and down as user scrolls on the page.)<br />
        <strong>background-position:</strong> can be used to position the image.
        You define it with 2 values: the first being the horizontal location (left,
        center, right) and the second the vertical (top, center, bottom.) You can
        also specify pixels, or a percentage. 0% 0% would be the top left. 50% 50%
        would center the image.
      </p>
      <h4>Background Shorthand</h4>
      <p>If you would like to combine these into one declaration, you can use them
        all with the property <strong>background:</strong> You must use them in the
        following order (although you can skip one if you would like):<br />
        <ul>
          <li>background-color:</li>
          <li>background-image:</li>
          <li>background-repeat:</li>
          <li>background-attachment:</li>
          <li>background-position:</li>
        </ul>
        So all put into one rule would look like:<br />
        <strong>background: #ffffff url("image.jpg") repeat scroll left top;</strong><br />
        If you would like to use a gradient for the background,
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp">here</a> is a great
        write-up on all the things you will need depending on browser. It's a fairly
        straight-forward process.
